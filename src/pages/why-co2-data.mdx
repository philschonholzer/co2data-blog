CO<sub>2</sub> is one of the major problems of our time. By releasing more CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere we are changing the climate. Change alone is not a problem, but the speed with which it is changing is unprecedented. And at the moment it looks like we are racing towards a catastrophy.

Even though CO<sub>2</sub> is talked about and written about a lot, we hardly know it. It feels a little bit like a foreign currency. We have no intuition about how much 100 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> is. Is it much? Is it little? It is really hard to say.

co2data.org tries to make a little bit more sense about CO<sub>2</sub>. How more CO<sub>2</sub> is released by what and by which amount? CO<sub>2</sub> did a good job. If people can tell how much 100 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> is and what commits more CO<sub>2</sub> than other things.

The hope is that by understanding CO<sub>2</sub> better, we can keep it better in check. If co2data.org can just push the needle a little bit in the right direction, that would be amazing.
